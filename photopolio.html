            I am a UX Designer and Art Director from Austria living in Berlin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artworks and illustrations were my gateway to the creative industry which led to the foundation of my own
            studio and to first steps in the digital world.

          Direction
          <p>
            Starting with basic websites several years ago I found myself working as an Art Director for complex
            projects with a holistic approach soon. Visually appealing designs, subtle details and brand guidelines
            combined to innovative interfaces across various touch points became my daily companion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of this love for aesthetic design my passion for functionality and structure evolved. Jumping right into
            Photoshop didn’t feel accurate anymore and skipping the steps of building a framework based on functionality
            and usability became inevitable.
          </p>

          UX Design
          <p>
            A user-centered mindset and sensitivity for design turned out to be the perfect fit when collaborating with
            agencies, clients and brands to develop digital concepts and solve problems together.
          </p>
          <p>
            This rough framework outlines my process of developing digital experiences:
          </p>
          ​
          <ol>
            <li><span>RESEARCH </span>and gather the present state</li>
            <li><span>STRUCTURE </span>setup and content of the project</li>
            <li><span>CONCEPT AND STRATEGY</span></li>
            <li><span>CREATE </span>
              , evaluate and iterate deliverables like
              <ul>
                <li>Personas</li>
                <li>Site maps</li>
                <li>Use cases and scenarios</li>
                <li>User flow</li>
                <li>Sketches and Infographics</li>
                <li>Wireframes</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Communicating the conceptual approach/UX strategy and reasoning behind it, is present during the whole
            process.

                  A research and concept phase which referred to an existing brand strategy set the course at
                  the beginning of this project. General use cases based on personas, information architecture
                  and detailed wireframes for the whole digital appearance followed.

                <p>
                  This appearance was structured into modules with a limited amount of additional functionalities

                  Austria Tourism asked for very detailed wireframes for both desktop and mobile devices

                  Especially the navigation concept which was tested with interactive click dummies was

                  structured at this point.

                Introducing the new generation running app – with this approach
                PUMA fired the starting pistol for a sophisticated and innovative
                design which had to be built from scratch. With PUMATRAC
                runners should be inspired and challenge themselves to reach
                their next milestone.

                  Reframing a running experience required various discovery and
                  conception phases, detailed research, different user experience
                  solutions and countless scribbled wireframes. A first thought of
                  processing into a gamification direction was discarded soon
                  – a minimalistic, straight forward approach made it definite.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example all basic elements needed for starting a run can be
                  found on the startscreen of the app. By tapping the run button
                  the next workout starts immediately which spares users to navigate
                  through run related settings.

                  One core challenge were the PUMATRAC
                  Milestones. Little badges that can be
                  achieved in various situations related to a
                  run. A framework that works for multiple
                  purposes had to be created.

                  Rough sketches outlined the design
                  process before refining each of them
                  digitally.

                  In addition to the PUMATRAC mobile app, the whole digital

                <p>
                  A responsive website to promote the app, a user backend to
                  login and see runs online, a visually appealing content
                  management system for the PUMA team and various social

                </p>
                <p>
                  The user backend and content management system were done
                  very cleanly whereas the promotional app had much more visual
                  value. Both were built to extend at any point to emphasise new
                  features.
